<h1>What's New in Kimono Designer</h1>
<p>Kimono Designer provides several key features that make it the perfect tool for designing SkiaSharp graphics that can be used in all of your cross-platform applications. This version offers the following new and improved features:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Source Code Export</b> - Added the ability to export the source code generated for the selected item to a text file.</li>
	<li><b>Source Code Generation</b> - Added the ability to emit C# code required to create any element of a portfolio (or the entire portfolio itself) that can then be included in a Xamarin based project. Select the language (C#, F#, Java, etc.), OS Platform (Mac, Android, iOS, Xamarin.Forms, etc.) and optionally be able to use the KimonoCore helper library in the emitted code.</li>
	<li><b>Welcome Screen</b> - Added a "Welcome" window that displays when the app is first launched with information about what new, start a new portfolio, open an existing portfolio, etc.</li>
	<li><b>Added File Save & Load</b> - Added the ability to save and load Kimono Designer Portfolios to/from disk.</li>
	<li><b>Tabbed UI</b> - Switched to a modern macOS App UI where multiple open projects will be opened or created as tabs in a single window, instead of opening multiple windows.</li>
