TextBase
============

TextBase is a simple ORM that can read and write .NET object to a string format that can be saved to files, included in applications or can be easily stored and transmitted over a cloud backend (such as Azure).

The design of the TextBase ORM is based off of [Sqlite.Net](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net) by Krueger Systems, Inc.

## Using TextBase

TextBase works by decorating the public properties of a .NET class with a custom set of attributes. From there, methods of the `TextBaseDatabase` class can be used to write and read those objects from a simple TextBase formatted string. For example:

```
using System;
using SkiaSharp;
using TextBase;

namespace KimonoCore
{
	[Table("BezierPoint")]
	public class KimonoBezierPoint
	{
		#region Computed Properties
		[Child]
		public SKPoint ControlPoint { get; set; } = new SKPoint();

		[Child]
		public SKPoint EndPoint { get; set; } = new SKPoint();
		#endregion

		...
		
		#region Save and Load
		public string Save() {
			var database = new TextBaseDatabase();

			return database.Save(this);
		}
		
		public void Load(string data) {
			var database = new TextBaseDatabase();

			// Register this class
			database.Register<KimonoBezierPoint>();

			// Restore object from data
			database.Load(data, this);
		}
		#endregion
}
```

To ensure that a given object gets property loaded by TextBase, call the `Register` method against that object _before_ calling the Load method. For example:

```
Register<KimonoBezierPoint>();
```

## Available Attributes

The following attributes can be used control how an object get written to and read from a string:

* `[AsString]` - Forces the value to be written and read as a string.
* `[Child]` - Marks the property as a sub-object that will be written and read from the string.
* `[Children]` - Marks a collection of sub-objects that will be written and read from the string.
* `[Column(name)]` - Assigns a different name to the property that is written to the string.
* `[Ignore]` - Marks a property that will not be written and read from the string.
* `[Primarykey]` - Marks the property that will be used as the primary key for the object.
* `[Serializer(name)]` - Allows the developer to create a custom serializer/deserializer for a property. See below for more details.
* `[Table(name)]` - Assigns a different name to the class that is written to the string.

## Custom Serializers

By using the `[Serializer(name)]` attribute and the `RequestCustomSerialization` and `RequestCustomDeserialization` events, custom data types can be written and read by TextBase. For example:

```
var database = new TextBaseDatabase();

// Add custom serialization
database.RequestCustomSerialization += (serializer, obj) =>
{
	var result = "";

	// Take action based on the serializer type
	switch (serializer)
	{
		case "SKColor":
			// Encode object...
			break;
	}

	// Return results
	return result;
};

// Add custom deserialization
database.RequestCustomDeserialization += (serializer, value) =>
{
	object result = null;

	// Take action based on the serializer type
	switch (serializer)
	{
		case "SKColor":
			// Decode object...
			break;
	}

	// Return results
	return result;
};
```

With this code in place, use `[Serializer(SKColor)]` to have TextBase handle the custom type:

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using SkiaSharp;
using TextBase;

namespace KimonoCore
{
	[Table("Style")]
	public class KimonoStyle : IKimonoCodeGeneration, IKimonoPropertyConsumer
	{
		...
		
		[Serializer("SKColor")]
		public SKColor FrameBaseColor
		{
			get { return Frame.Color; }
			set { Frame.Color = value; }
		}
		
		...
	}
}
```
